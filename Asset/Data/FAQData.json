		"question" : "What is a cataract?",
		"answer" : "When the natural lens in your eye becomes cloudy and affects vision, it is a cataract. Cataracts can occur at any age, but are most common in people over the age of 60. Cataracts cause blurry vision and glare making it difficult to read, watch TV, and drive."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What is cataract surgery?",
		"answer" : "Cataract surgery is a delicate surgery that starts by making a very small (2-3mm) incision through the cornea,the clear window of the eye. An opening is made on the front of the cataract so that the cataract can be broken up and removed using ultrasound. The replacement lens is placed in the bag where the cataract came from and the eye is resealed."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What is laser cataract surgery?",
		"answer" : "A laser can be used to do some of the steps of cataract surgery and also reshape the cornea to reduce astigmatism. It can also help break up very dense cataracts. Your eye surgeon will discuss whether or not laser cataract surgery is right for you."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What is astigmatism?",
		"answer" : "Astigmatism is when the cornea is oval shaped like a football instead of round like a basketball. If you have astigmatism, your glasses correct it by using the opposite shape to straighten out the image."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What are the lens choices?",
		"answer" : "The standard lens helps you see at distance.  Patients wear either bifocals or readers after surgery. The standard lens is covered by insurance. A toric lens corrects astigmatism, making the image clearer if you have astigmatism. Patients still need glasses for reading. Multifocal lenses help patients see both distance and near. Patients can get by without glasses most of the time but may see halos around lights at night.Your surgeon will recommend which lens is the best option for you."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Should I stop my blood thinner?",
		"answer" : "In general, it is not necessary to stop a blood thinner before uncomplicated cataract surgery, but ask your surgeon."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Does cataract surgery hurt?",
		"answer" : "Your cataract surgeon will use numbing medicine on the surface of the eye, inside the eye, and/or next to the eye. Also,the anesthesia team will give you relaxing and pain medication through your I.V. to keep you comfortable throughout the whole surgery.  If you feel any pain, just let them know and they will give you extra medicine."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Will I be awake during surgery?",
		"answer" : "Depending on how your body reacts to the anesthesia, you may remember all of the surgery, some of the surgery, or none of the surgery. Each person is a little different and most people remember the second surgery more than the first one. If you are feeling anxious, just let the anesthesia team know and they can give you extra medicine."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Will I see anything during the surgery?",
		"answer" : "It is normal to see shadows and colors during surgery."
	},
	{
		"question" : "Will my eye hurt after surgery?",
		"answer" : "It is normal for the eye to feel scratched or irritated like there is a hair in the eye. This goes away in the first day or two. If you have severe pain, severe headache, or nausea/vomiting, call your surgeon’s contact number immediately."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What if my drops are too expensive?",
		"answer" : "Call your surgeon’s office. It is a good idea to fill your eye drops a few days before surgery. Some drops are generic, covered by insurance, and reasonably priced. Some drops are name brand, may not be covered by insurance, and may be more expensive. Sometimes there is a sample available, but websites like GoodRx.com can also help."
	},
	{
		"question" : "What if my vision is blurry?",
		"answer" : "It is normal for the vision to be blurry the day of surgery and may take a week or more to clear. Glasses are usually prescribed 3-4 weeks after surgery and may be needed for your best vision. It is normal to see halos around light, especially if you have a multifocal lens."
